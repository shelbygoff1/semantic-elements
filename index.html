      <h2><b>Assignment Paragraph</b></h2>
      <p>Semantic is defined as relating to meaning in language or logic. Simply put, semantic elements have names that actually mean something. Before semantic elements in HTML, it was difficult to distinguish specific sections. Looking at content surrounded by a non-semantic div tag, it’s hard to determine what the content is about from a first look. By replacing this tag with a semantic element tag such as article, footer or figure code is much more readable. For example, this and introductory paragraph on this sample page about dogs. It is coded in the p element so you can clearly tell that it is a separate paragraph. I’ve used other tags to easily see lists, images and captions in the code. If non-semantic elements were used, it would be much harder to look at this draft HTML site and understand exactly what all the code translates to on the actual webpage. </p>
